# Feedback

## Overall structure
- The file structure is consistent with a folder for each page and a folder for each component.
- The readme file is well-organized and provides a clear overview of the project.

## Use of supabase
- The use of supabase is well integrated into the project. The fact that you are also using supabase for your queries is a good practice. Instead of handling the queries in the frontend, you are using the backend to handle the queries. WHen having a large amount of data, this is a good practice. So, it's going to be useful for you in the future.

## React-router
- The use of react-router is well done. The routes are well defined and the navigation is smooth. 
- You are also handling params and query strings in the routes which is a good practice.

## Components
- The components are well-structured.
- Some of the pages have a lot of code in them. You could consider breaking them down into smaller components to make the code more readable and maintainable.

## Styling
- There is some css files that are not indented and a lot of comments in them. You could consider removing the comments and indenting the css files to make them more readable.
- The project is responsive and looks good on different screen sizes. 

## Use of AI
- When asking an AI to solve a problem, it's important to understand its limitations. The code it provides is not always the best/simplest solution, and it's important to review it and understand what it's doing. Try to ask more specific questions to get better results and also ask for explanations of the code provided.
- When styling with css, AI is definitely not a good option. It's better to write the css yourself.
